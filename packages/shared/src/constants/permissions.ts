// Canonical permission registry — the single source of truth for resource:action
// grants. Shared so the API (requirePermission, role seeding) and the web UI
// (permission-aware nav/action gating) type their permission references against
// the same closed set. The API re-exports this as `PERMISSIONS` from
// `services/permissions.ts`; the web derives `PermissionGrant`/`PermissionResource`/
// `PermissionAction` for its gate literals.
//
// Adding a permission: add it here (and to DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS in the API seed +
// a migration that inserts the row). A typo'd resource/action in any gate then
// fails to compile instead of silently never matching.
//
// NB: named PERMISSION_GRANTS (not PERMISSIONS) to avoid colliding with the
// older nested PERMISSIONS constant in this package.
