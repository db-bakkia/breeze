// windowsInputBlockBackend blocks local physical input via the Win32 BlockInput
// API.
//
// BlockInput(TRUE) blocks all physical keyboard and mouse input. Two properties
// make it the right v1 primitive for issue #966:
//
//   - Injected input is NOT blocked. SendInput from the thread that called
//     BlockInput continues to work, so the remote operator's mouse/keyboard
//     (which the agent injects through WindowsInputHandler.HandleEvent) keeps
//     flowing while the on-site user's physical input is swallowed. That is
//     exactly the "stop fighting for control" behaviour the issue asks for.
//   - Ctrl+Alt+Del (the Secure Attention Sequence) is intentionally NOT blocked
//     by BlockInput, so the local user can always escape to the secure desktop.
//     This is a deliberate Windows safety guarantee, not a gap.
//
// Requirements / caveats:
//   - Requires the calling process to be running with the same or higher
//     integrity/privileges as the foreground thread; the agent runs as the
//     LocalSystem service, which satisfies this.
//   - If the calling THREAD exits, Windows automatically releases the block.
//     Combined with process-death release, this is our primary crash-safety
//     guarantee — a dead agent can never leave the keyboard wedged.
//   - BlockInput is also released automatically when the system switches to the
//     secure desktop (e.g. the user hits Ctrl+Alt+Del), and Windows re-enables
//     it on return. No action needed from us.
//
// FUTURE (not in this slice): for finer control — e.g. allowing specific local
// keys, or surviving secure-desktop transitions differently — switch to
// low-level hooks (SetWindowsHookEx WH_KEYBOARD_LL / WH_MOUSE_LL) which give
// per-event veto power. Hooks need a message pump on the hooking thread and
// careful teardown on every exit path, so they are deferred until the simpler
// BlockInput approach is proven on real targets.
