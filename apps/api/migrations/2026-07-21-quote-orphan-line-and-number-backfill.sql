-- Data-only repair for two quote defects that were fixed on the WRITE path only,
-- leaving every pre-existing row permanently broken. No DDL: no new tables, no
-- new columns, no RLS/cascade registration required.
--
-- PART A — orphan quote lines (#2553)
--   `quote_lines.block_id` is nullable. A line with block_id IS NULL renders in
--   the PDF, the portal and the preview and counts in every total, but the web
--   editor walks `quote_blocks` only, so the line is invisible AND uneditable
--   there — a quote showing a real dollar total while the builder says
--   "No content yet". `resolveLineBlockId` (quoteService.ts, v0.96.0) fixed new
--   writes; rows written before that were never repaired.
--   Repair: attach every orphan to its quote's EARLIEST line_items block,
--   creating exactly ONE such block per quote if the quote has none. Mirrors
--   resolveLineBlockId exactly: content '{}'::jsonb, sort_order =
--   COALESCE(MAX(sort_order), -1) + 1 over the quote's existing blocks.
--
-- PART B — quotes stuck with no number (#2227)
--   quote_number used to be allocated at SEND time and is nullable. Commit
--   0b718d658 (v0.92.0) moved allocation to CREATE time, but drafts created
--   before that keep quote_number = NULL forever and there is NO UI to assign
--   one — a user was left completely stuck.
--   Repair: allocate ONLY for never-sent quotes (sent_at IS NULL). A quote a
--   customer may already hold a copy of must never have its number rewritten,
--   even if that number is NULL.
--   Numbers are allocated THROUGH `partner_quote_sequences`, exactly as
--   `allocateQuoteCounter` does, so this backfill cannot collide with future
--   allocations or with the partial unique index
--   `quotes_partner_number_uq ON quotes (partner_id, quote_number) WHERE quote_number IS NOT NULL`.
--   Format matches formatQuoteNumber('Q', year, counter) -> 'Q-<year>-<0000>'.
--
-- IDEMPOTENCY: both parts are self-limiting — Part A only touches
-- block_id IS NULL, Part B only quote_number IS NULL. After one successful run
-- both predicates match nothing, so a re-run allocates no counters, creates no
-- blocks and updates no rows. Re-application is a complete no-op.
-- The ONE exception is the pathological Part B path where a quote is SKIPPED
-- after 50 colliding allocations (see below): that quote stays NULL, so a
-- re-run retries it and burns 50 more counter values. This cannot happen unless
-- a partner's sequence has fallen behind its own quote numbers, and the
-- migration RAISEs a WARNING naming the quote when it does — burning counters
-- is strictly better than aborting the whole migration on a unique violation.
--
-- No inner BEGIN;/COMMIT; — autoMigrate wraps each file in a transaction.

-- quotes/quote_lines/quote_blocks are RLS-FORCED (org policies) and
-- partner_quote_sequences is partner-RLS. The migration connection (managed-DB
-- doadmin, no request GUCs) is NOT exempt: without system scope Part A's
-- SELECTs match zero rows (silent no-op, recorded as applied) and Part B's
-- INSERT fails its WITH CHECK with 42501, aborting the boot. Transaction-local
-- elevation, same pattern as 2026-04-13-fix-uuid-hostnames.sql. (Superuser
-- runs — CI, stock self-host compose — bypass RLS either way.)
