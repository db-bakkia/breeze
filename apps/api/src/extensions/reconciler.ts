// The startup reconciler for SIGNED runtime-extension bundles.
//
// For each configured extension it runs an explicit phase pipeline —
// acquire → trust → verify → observe → compatibility → extract → load →
// migrate → publish-tenancy → stage → validate → activate — under a strict
// failure policy:
//
//   • An OPTIONAL extension that fails ANY phase records a SANITIZED failure,
//     is withdrawn from the contribution registry, is added to summary.failed,
//     and the loop moves on. Its contributions are never exposed.
//   • A REQUIRED extension that fails throws RequiredExtensionError, aborting
//     boot (after the same sanitized-failure + withdraw bookkeeping).
//
// Boot safety: a missing `extensions.yaml` (the common case) is a clean no-op —
// nothing is created, no DB client is opened, boot proceeds. Only a present but
// malformed config fails closed (a trust boundary: silently ignoring it could
// skip a required extension).
//
// Every dependency is an injectable PORT (mirroring the state-store backend
// seam) so the failure-policy unit tests need no bundle, filesystem, or DB.
