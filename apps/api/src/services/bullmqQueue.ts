/**
 * bullmqQueue — shared, #1105-instrumented BullMQ Queue factory.
 *
 * Why this exists: there is no single chokepoint for enqueues in this codebase —
 * each worker module constructs its own `new Queue(...)` and calls `queue.add()`
 * directly. That made the #1105 txn-around-slow-work foot-gun (a held
 * `withDbAccessContext` transaction pinning a pooled connection idle across a
 * Redis enqueue) undetectable per-enqueue: it took a production incident to find
 * each instance by hand (#1116, #1313).
 *
 * `createInstrumentedQueue(name, opts)` is a drop-in replacement for
 * `new Queue(name, { connection: getBullMQConnection(), ... })` that wires the
 * `assertOutsideHeldDbContext` tripwire (#1105) into the queue's `add()` /
 * `addBulk()` so EVERY enqueue made through it reports when it runs inside a
 * held DB transaction. Warn-only by default (prod-safe, mirroring the
 * contextless-write guard #1375); set `DB_CONTEXT_TRIPWIRE_STRICT` to throw so a
 * newly-introduced violation fails the build. The fix at a flagged call site is
 * to enqueue AFTER the context closes, or to wrap the enqueue in
 * `runOutsideDbContext(...)` (which exits the context, making the guard a no-op).
 *
 * Adopting this factory across queue constructors is incremental: callers that
 * still use bare `new Queue(...)` simply aren't instrumented yet. Start with the
 * agent/reconnect blast-radius queues (the #1105 trigger surface) and migrate
 * the rest over time.

/**
 * Construct a BullMQ Queue whose enqueue methods are guarded by the #1105
 * held-context tripwire. `connection` defaults to the shared BullMQ Redis
 * connection, so most callers pass only the queue name (and optionally
 * `defaultJobOptions`).
 *
 * The returned object IS a real `Queue` — `add` and `addBulk` are wrapped in
 * place, so existing call sites (`queue.add(...)`, `queue.getJob(...)`,
 * `queue.close()`, …) work unchanged.
