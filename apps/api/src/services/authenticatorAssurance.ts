 * Two L2 factors, discriminated on `proof.type`:
 *  - `webauthn_platform` (Phase 2): a browser WebAuthn assertion, verified via
 *    @simplewebauthn against the device's stored public key.
 *  - `mobile_hw_key` (Phase 3): a Secure-Enclave / Keystore RSA-SHA256 signature
 *    over the single-use server nonce, verified against the device's stored SPKI
 *    public key. `proof.credentialId` carries the approver device id.
 *
 * The L3/L4 ladder is derived from the SAME signature plus context — no PIN:
 *  - L3 (high): the verified L2 signature, plus a RECENCY check — the
 *    approval-assertion challenge must have been issued within
 *    `APPROVAL_CHALLENGE_TTL_MS`. The issued-at is read server-side from the
 *    consumed challenge (it travels with the nonce in Redis), NOT supplied by
 *    the route — so a stale-but-valid signature is rejected automatically.
 *  - L4 (critical): L3 conditions, plus a hardware/platform-bound key
 *    (`device.is_platform_bound`) and a FRESH account re-authentication
 *    (`reauthVerified === true`, satisfied inline at the decide surface — this
 *    is the only route-supplied factor).
 *
 * Non-blocking by design:
 *  - No proof presented → today's behavior (session tap, L1). NEVER blocks here.
 *    Enforcing that a proof is REQUIRED for a given tier is Phase 4.
 *  - Proof present and valid → L2 (factor recorded, anti-clone counter bumped),
 *    escalated to L3/L4 when the tier's recency / re-auth factors are satisfied.
 *  - Proof present but INVALID (device not registered/disabled, nonce expired or
 *    tampered, or signature fails) → throw. A presented-but-bad proof is an
 *    error, not a silent downgrade to L1.
 *  - The L3 recency window blown, or an L4 critical missing its platform-bound
 *    key / re-auth → throw (RecencyExpiredError / ReauthRequiredError). A
 *    higher tier is never silently recorded at a lower achieved level.
