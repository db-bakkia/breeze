 * §5) — the release worker's trust boundary: a reconstructed identity is
 * about to execute a real, privileged Tier-3 action, so this must fail
 * CLOSED on any doubt. Returns `null` on ANY validation failure; the caller
 * (`jobs/intentReleaseWorker.ts`) maps a `null` result to intent
 * `failed: actor_invalid` and never falls back to a looser context.
 *
 * Reuses `buildOrgAccessClosures` + `siteAccessCheck` (middleware/auth.ts) —
 * the SAME closure factories `authMiddleware` uses to build the request-path
 * AuthContext — so org/site access semantics can never drift between "live
 * request" and "durable release" execution.

 * the `buildAuthFromApiKey` reconstruction in routes/mcpServer.ts. Rather
 * than fork a partial, untested copy of that (non-exported, ~90-line)
 * logic now, this checks the key is still live and then fails closed with a
