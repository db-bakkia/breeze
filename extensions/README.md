# Breeze Extensions

> **DEPRECATED: source-directory (build-time) extension loading.**
> The supported delivery path is a **signed runtime bundle**: declare the
> artifact in `extensions.yaml` in this directory and the host verifies,
> migrates, stages, and activates it at startup (see
> `docs/extensions/build-time-transition.md` for the transition and its dated
> removal gate). Source-directory loading described below still works for **one
> compatibility window** and only when `BREEZE_LEGACY_SOURCE_EXTENSIONS=true`
> is set; each loaded source extension emits a structured deprecation warning.
> A source directory and a runtime artifact may **not** be enabled under the
> same extension name — the boot fails rather than letting one silently shadow
> the other. Stock images no longer build or bake in `extensions/*` sources.

This directory hosts the runtime deployment config (`extensions.yaml`) and,
during the compatibility window only, legacy source extension checkouts:

    git clone <extension-repo-url> extensions/<name>

Note `extensions/*` is no longer a pnpm workspace glob: a cloned extension
manages its own dependencies and build (`pnpm install && pnpm build` inside the
checkout); the loader runs `dist/index.cjs` in production and the TS source
entry in dev.

Each legacy extension carries a `breeze-extension.json`
manifest (validated by `@breeze/extension-api`) that declares:

- `name` — lowercase slug; also the migration-ledger prefix (`<name>/<file>.sql`)
- `routeNamespace` — routes mount at `/api/v1/<routeNamespace>`
- `entry` — TS source entry (dev); prod loads `dist/index.cjs` if present
- `migrationsDir` — raw SQL migrations, same rules as `apps/api/migrations/`
  (idempotent, no inner BEGIN/COMMIT, `^\d{4}-.*\.sql$`, never edit shipped)
- `tenancy` — table registrations consumed by the org/device cascade machinery
  and contract tests

Extension tables MUST ship RLS policies in their creating migration, exactly
like core tables (see CLAUDE.md "Tenant Isolation / RLS"). Tables with an
`org_id` column are auto-discovered by the RLS coverage contract test.

With `extensions/` empty, every build, test, and boot path behaves exactly as
before — the seam is a no-op. Set `BREEZE_EXTENSIONS_ENABLED=false` to skip
loading even when extensions are present.

## Lockfile policy

Extension importers must NOT appear in the public `pnpm-lock.yaml` — a private
extension's dependency graph would leak. Since `extensions/*` is no longer a
workspace glob this now holds automatically: `pnpm install` at the repo root
ignores extension checkouts, and stock Docker images neither install nor build
them. A legacy checkout installs and builds inside its own directory with its
own lockfile.

## SDK dependencies

Core Breeze apps and packages consume the committed extension SDK packages
under `packages/` through `workspace:*` dependencies. Keep that resolution
inside the root workspace; do not add checkout-specific package paths or
overrides to the root manifest or public lockfile.

A legacy extension checkout remains a self-contained project. It declares,
installs, locks, and builds its own SDK dependencies inside its checkout rather
than relying on the Breeze root workspace to resolve them.

For local dev environment variables and service overrides an extension
needs when running against the dev stack (container env, secrets, extra
mounts), the pattern is an untracked `docker-compose.*.override.yml` layered
on top of `docker-compose.yml`, plus a gitignored `.env.*` file loaded via
that override's `env_file:` key. Commit only a `.env.*.example` template
with placeholder values — never a real secret, and never a real secret's
value in the override YAML itself, even though the YAML file stays
untracked (untracked files still sit in plaintext on disk and are easy to
`git add -A` by accident).

## Seam v2: manifest flags and ExtensionContext

### `agentRoutes` manifest flag

Set `agentRoutes: true` in `breeze-extension.json` when the extension mounts
routes under `/api/v1/<routeNamespace>/agent/` that are authenticated with
`ctx.agentAuthMiddleware` (device/agent tokens) rather than user sessions.
The core loader responds by registering that path prefix as a skip-prefix on
the global per-IP rate limiter (`registerGlobalRateLimitSkipPrefix`), the
same treatment core's own `/api/v1/agents/` and `/api/v1/helper/` routes get.
This is safe because agent-token auth carries its own per-agent/per-org
limits independent of the global per-IP bucket — device fleets share IPs
(NAT, proxies) and would otherwise collide with the same limit budget as
interactive dashboard traffic. Only set this flag for routes actually gated
by agent-token auth; do not use it to bypass rate limiting on user-facing
routes.

### `deviceOrgMoveDeleteTables` tenancy list

Register a `device_id`-bearing extension table here when its rows must be
**deleted**, not org_id-re-stamped, when a device moves to a different
organization (`PATCH` device org-move flow). Use this instead of
`deviceOrgDenormalizedTables` when the table's rows FK a source/config row
(e.g. an extension-owned sources/config table) that stays behind in the old
org — rewriting `org_id` on the child row alone would leave it pointing at a
parent row in a different tenant, corrupting cross-row consistency under RLS.
Core deletes these rows (via `getDeviceOrgMoveDeleteTables()`, which merges
core and extension registrations) in the same transaction as the org-move,
immediately after the denormalized-column rewrite pass. Tables that don't have this FK
shape and can simply have `org_id` rewritten in place belong in
`deviceOrgDenormalizedTables` instead.

### New `ExtensionContext` members

- **`agentAuthMiddleware`** — Core's agent-token auth middleware. Apply it to
  any route intended for devices/agents rather than logged-in users; it
  validates the agent token, sets `c.get('agent')` to an
  `ExtensionAgentContext` (`deviceId`, `agentId`, `orgId`, `siteId`, `role`),
  and opens the request's org RLS context accordingly. Routes under this
  middleware should also be declared via the `agentRoutes` manifest flag (see
  above) so they're excluded from the global per-IP rate limiter — agent auth
  enforces its own per-agent/per-org limits instead.

- **`db`** — Core's ALS-bound Drizzle handle (`ExtensionDatabase`), scoped to
  the ambient request via Node's `AsyncLocalStorage`. It runs *inside* the
  same request-scoped RLS transaction core uses — the Postgres session GUCs
  that scope row visibility to the caller's org are already set, so plain
  queries against extension tables are automatically tenant-isolated as long
  as the tables carry an `org_id` column with RLS policies (see "Tenant
  Isolation / RLS" in the root `CLAUDE.md`). `ExtensionDatabase` is a
  structural type exposing only `execute()`; cast it to your own Drizzle
  database type to get full query-builder ergonomics:
  `const db = ctx.db as unknown as PostgresJsDatabase<typeof myExtensionSchema>;`
  The extension must pin the same `drizzle-orm` version as core to keep the
  wire format compatible.

- **`secrets`** — Column-bound `encryptForColumn(table, column, plaintext)` /
  `decryptForColumn(table, column, ciphertext)` helpers backed by core's
  encryption-at-rest primitives. Use these for any extension-owned secret
  column (API tokens, credentials, etc.) instead of rolling your own crypto.
  Important: extension secret columns are **not** entries in core's
  `encryptedColumnRegistry` (`apps/api/src/services/encryptedColumnRegistry.ts`)
  — that registry only tracks core tables. Key-rotation tooling built against
  `encryptedColumnRegistry` will not discover or rotate extension secret
  columns; an extension that stores encrypted secrets is responsible for its
  own key-rotation tooling and runbook.

- **`audit`** — `(event: ExtensionAuditEvent) => Promise<void>`. Queues an
  audit-log entry with fire-and-forget retry semantics (same pipeline core
  routes use via `createAuditLogAsync`). Call this after any state-changing
  action so it shows up in the org's audit trail; set `actorType: 'agent'`
  for actions taken by a device/agent (routes behind `agentAuthMiddleware`)
  versus `'user'` / `'api_key'` / `'system'` as appropriate. The call does
  not block on write completion, so don't rely on it for read-your-writes
  consistency.

## Trust boundary & lifecycle

- Anything that can write to `extensions/` or set `BREEZE_EXTENSIONS_DIR`
  can execute arbitrary code in the API process. Protect the extension
  directory like the API binary itself.
- Removing a previously migrated extension leaves its tables and data in
  place. Organization cascade-delete then fails loudly: the transaction rolls
  back with no partial erasure until the extension is restored, or its tables
  are dropped and its `<name>/` migration-ledger rows are deleted.
- `RESERVED_ROUTE_NAMESPACES` in `@breeze/extension-api` is maintained by
  hand. When core mounts a new `/api/v1` namespace, add it to that list (and
  to the ground-truth contract array in `packages/extension-api/src/index.test.ts`).
  Regenerate the inner-mount list with
  `grep -oE "api\.route\('/[a-z0-9-]+" apps/api/src/index.ts`, then add the
  outer-app mounts that bypass that router: `oauth`, `settings`, and the
  shortlink prefix `s`.
